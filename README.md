### Expense Tracker Bot

## Motivation
I have tried using apps to track my expenses, however I always end up forgetting to key in my spendings. Moreover, most apps are payable if I wish to add notes for my transactions. So, I thought of building a telegram bot to track my expense since telegram is my most used application, hence I will be reminded to key in my spendings everytime I open telegram.
